The brief for assignment 2 was to make a Chindogu under the topic of "on the move".

This project consists of a gps, a DC motor and a usb webcam. 
When the person is identified to be asleep based on the photos taken of them, and the distance to their destination goes below a threshold, the device ring a bell to wake them up in time.

To run the program, it is also necessary to download "shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat" from https://github.com/italojs/facial-landmarks-recognition/blob/master/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat
